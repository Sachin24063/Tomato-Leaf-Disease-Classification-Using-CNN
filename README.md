# Tomato-Leaf-Disease-Classification-Using-CNN


the Farmers who grow tomatoes face large economic losses every year and a large amount of waste yearly because of the various diseases that occur in Tomato crops. So the quality and quantity of tomatoes go down daily. If farmers have detected these many problems earliest as possible and apply appropriate action then it can save lots of waste and stop the economic losses every year. Towards action of those problems is a little different for case wise. But the important thing is farmers accurately detect those diseases earlier in tomato plants and observe what kind of disease occurred in the Tomato plants. Then farmers are able to prevent economic losses and a large amount of waste. 

In this  project, we classify tomato leaves in 10 diffrent classes. for detecting the disease in tomato leaves.


The Folder structure for given project is given below.

- UI 
This Folder Contains all the UI codes like CSS,java script and node js.


- Saved_Model
This Folder Contains some of the diffrent created models for version control.

- API
In this folder there is a python file for build the FASTAPI server.

- training.ipynb
This File contains all the python code for data load, transform, data cleaning and model creation. and also save the model in diffrent versions.
